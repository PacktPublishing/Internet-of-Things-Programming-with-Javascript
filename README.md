This is the code repository for [Internet of Things Programming with JavaScript](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/internet-things-programming-javascript?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785888564), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
The Internet of Things (IoT) is an entirely new platform for developers and engineers, but one thing that remains consistent as we move into this new world, are the programming languages. JavaScript is the most widely used language over the Internet, and with IoT gaining momentum, you will learn how to harness the power of JavaScript to interact with connected devices. This book will teach you how to interact with endpoint devices by developing web services in JavaScript and also set up an interface to control all connected devices.
##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:

Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "Extract 2015-09-24-raspbian-jessie.img to your Home folder."

A block of code is set as follows:
```
# passwd
root@raspberrypi:/home/pi# passwd
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully
root@raspberrypi:/home/pi#
```


When we wish to draw your attention to a articular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:

<pre>
[default]
exten => s,1,Dial(Zap/1|30)
exten => s,2,Voicemail(u100)
<b>exten => s,102,Voicemail(b100)</b>
exten => i,1,Voicemail(s0)
</pre>

Any command-line input or output is written as follows:

**`sudo npm install express request`**


Youâ€™ll need the following software:
* Win32 Disk Imager 0.9.5 PuTTY
* i2C-tools
* WiringPi2 for Python
* Node.js 4.5 or later
* Node.js for Windows V7.3.0 or later
* Python 2.7.x or Python 3.x
* PHP MyAdmin Database
* MySQL module
* Create and account in Gmail so that you can get in APP Inventor
* Android Studio and SDK modules
* Arduino software

In the first chapters, we explain all the basics so you will have everything configured and will be able to use the Raspberry Pi Zero without any problems, so you can use it for the projects in this book. We will use some basic components, such as sensors, and move to more complex components in the rest of the book. On the software side, it is good if you actually have some existing programming skills, especially in JavaScript and in the Node.js framework. However, I will explain all the parts of each software piece of this book, so even if you don't have good programming skills in JavaScript you will be able to follow along.
